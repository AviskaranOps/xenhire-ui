    "I graduated with a Bachelorâs degree in Computer Science from XYZ University, where I developed a solid foundation in programming, software development, and user-centered design principles. During my studies, I took several courses on human-computer interaction, which sparked my interest in UX/UI design. After university, I completed a specialized certification in UX Design from ABC Institute, where I honed my skills in user research, wireframing, and prototyping. This certification program included a capstone project where I redesigned the interface of a local e-commerce website. I conducted user interviews, created personas, and developed a prototype that improved the siteâs usability and overall user experience.",
